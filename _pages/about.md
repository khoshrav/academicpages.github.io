I am a  third year student in the M.S./Ph.D. program at the College of Information and Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
I work under the guidance of Professor [Rod Grupen](http://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~grupen/) at the [Laboratory of Perceptual Robotics](https://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/). 

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from [K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce) in 2016 and proceeded to work as a Software Developer at [Aitoe Labs](http://www.aitoelabs.com/) developing video analytics softwares for online surveillance, search and summarization. 
While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to work on a few extremely interesting projects including [Square Off](http://squareoffnow.com/) and [Team Eta](http://www.teameta.in/).
